        <h4 id="aboutsubhead">Ram's early years</h4>
      
         <div class="aboutbody" id="earlyyears1">
          <p>
            Dieter Rams was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1932. He was strongly influenced by the presence of his grandfather who was a carpenter. Rams’s early awards for carpentry led to him training as an architect as Germany was rebuilt in the early&nbsp;1950s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prompted by an eagle-eyed friend, Rams applied for a job at the German electrical products company, Braun, in 1955. He was recruited by Erwin and Artur Braun following the death of their father and his job was to modernize the interiors of the company that was launching revolutionary electrical&nbsp;products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rams became a protégé of the Ulm School of Design (successor to the Bauhaus) luminaries Hans Gugelot, Fritz Eichler and Otl&nbsp;Aicher.
          </p>
          <p>
            He quickly became involved in product design – famously adding the clear perspex lid to the SK4 phonogram in 1956 – and was appointed head of design at Braun from 1961 to&nbsp;1995.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together with his design team, he was responsible for many of the seminal domestic electrical products – and some furniture – of the 20th&nbsp;century.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="aboutsubhead3">Rams’s philosophy</h4>

        <div class="aboutbody" id="philosophy">
          <p>
            In 1976 Rams delivered a frank and prescient speech in New York. It was titled ‘Design by Vitsœ’ and in it he asserted his commitment to responsible&nbsp;design.
          </p>
          <p>
            He drew attention to an “increasing and irreversible shortage of natural resources”. Believing that good design can only come from an understanding of people, Rams asked designers – indeed, everyone – to take more responsibility for the state of the world around&nbsp;them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I imagine our current situation will cause future generations to shudder at the thoughtlessness in the way in which we today fill our homes, our cities and our landscape with a chaos of assorted&nbsp;junk.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever since Rams has been an outspoken voice calling for “an end to the era of wastefulness” and to consider how we can continue to live on a planet with finite resources if we simply throw everything&nbsp;away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dieter Rams’s work has been widely exhibited worldwide via both touring and permanent exhibitions. He and his wife have established the Dieter and Ingeborg Rams Foundation to promote the views they hold so dear and to encourage all of us to live more serene and meaningful&nbsp;lives.

        <h4 id="aboutsubhead2">Ten principles for good design</h4>

        <div class="aboutbody" id="principles">
          <p>
            Back in the late 1970s, Dieter Rams was becoming increasingly concerned by the state of the world around him: “An impenetrable confusion of forms, colours and&nbsp;noises.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself an important question: is my design good&nbsp;design?
          </p>
          <p>
            His answer is expressed in his ten principles for good&nbsp;design.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="aboutbody" id="principleslist">
          <h5>
            1. Good design is innovative
          </h5>
          <p>
            The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in&nbsp;itself.
          </p>

          <h5>
            2. Good design makes a product useful
          </h5>
          <p>
            A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from&nbsp;it.
          </p>

          <h5>
            3. Good design is aesthetic
          </h5>
          <p>
            The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be&nbsp;beautiful.
          </p>

          <h5>
            4. Good design makes a product understandable
          </h5>
          <p>
            It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.
          </p>

          <h5>
            5. Good design is unobtrusive
          </h5>
          <p>
            Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.
          </p>

          <h5>
            6. Good design is honest
          </h5>
          <p>
            It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be&nbsp;kept.
          </p>

          <h5>
            7. Good design is long-lasting
          </h5>
          <p>
            It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway&nbsp;society.
          </p>

          <h5>
            8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail
          </h5>
          <p>
            Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the&nbsp;user.
          </p>

          <h5>
            9. Good design is environmentally-friendly
          </h5>
          <p>
            Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the&nbsp;product.
          </p>

          <h5>
            10. Good design is as little design as possible
          </h5>
          <p>
            Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to&nbsp;simplicity.
